# Retail-Sales-Analysis
This project provides an analysis of a fashion retail dataset. The goal is to uncover insights into product performance, sales trends, and customer behavior to derive actionable recommendations for the business.

# Key Questions Addressed
This analysis was structured to answer the following strategic questions:

1.  **Product Performance:** Which products drive the most revenue, and which underperform?
2.  **Sales Trends:** How do sales trends change over time, and are there clear monthly or seasonal patterns?
3.  **Customer Value:** Who are the highest-value customers, and how much do they contribute to total sales?
4.  **Ratings Impact:** How do product ratings impact repeat purchases and sales volume?
5.  **Transaction Value:** What is the average transaction value (ATV), and how does it vary by product?
6.  **Payment Behavior:** Which payment methods are most used, and do they influence purchase size?
7.  **Price vs. Satisfaction:** Are there clear links between product price and customer satisfaction ratings?

# Tools Used
* **Data Cleaning:** Excel
* **Data Analysis & Visualization:** Microsoft Power BI
* **Reporting:** Microsoft Word

# Key Findings & Insights

* **Price is not a proxy for satisfaction.** The analysis revealed **no correlation** between a product's price and the review rating it receives. Quality and customer experience are the true drivers of satisfaction.
* **Sales are highly seasonal.** The business experiences predictable revenue peaks in the Spring (March, May) and a significant dip in late Summer (August).
* **Core products and customers drive revenue.** A small group of products (Handbags, Tunics, Jeans) and a small segment of high-value customers are responsible for a disproportionate amount of total revenue. The top 10 customers alone account for nearly 8% of all sales.
* **Good reviews are linked to loyalty.** Items purchased by repeat customers have a slightly higher average rating, suggesting that positive product experiences encourage customer retention.
* **Payment methods are evenly split.** Customers show an almost 50/50 preference for Credit Card vs. Cash, with no significant difference in the average purchase amount between the two.

# Actionable Recommendations
Based on the analysis, the following strategic recommendations are proposed:

1.  **Implement a Tiered Inventory Strategy:**
    * **Action:** Classify products into performance tiers. Ensure top-tier items like **Handbags** and **Jeans** are always in stock. Consider promotional bundling or discontinuing underperforming items.
    * **Impact:** Reduce holding costs for slow-moving stock and maximize revenue from proven sellers.

2.  **Align Marketing with Seasonality:**
    * **Action:** Plan marketing campaigns to coincide with the proven sales peaks in spring. During the August trough, run targeted promotions (e.g., "End of Summer Sale") to stimulate demand.
    * **Impact:** Maximize marketing ROI and stabilize revenue during traditionally slow months.

3.  **Develop a High-Value Customer Program:**
    * **Action:** Create a loyalty or VIP program targeting the top 10% of spenders. Offer exclusive previews, personalized discounts, or early access to new collections.
    * **Impact:** Increase retention and lifetime value of the most profitable customer segment.

4.  **Focus on Quality Across All Price Points:**
    * **Action:** Since customer satisfaction is not tied to price, ensure rigorous quality control for all products. Use customer feedback from ratings to identify and address quality issues.
    * **Impact:** Enhance customer trust and encourage repeat purchases.
